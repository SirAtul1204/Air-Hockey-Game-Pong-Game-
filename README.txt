This is my version of the Air Hockey (Pong) Game developed using Python3 and Kivy 1.11.0

To run this program, you need to
    Download Python3, PyGame and Kivy 1.11.0
    Run main.py
    Enjoy!


*** Play with Computer option is not available yet but will be added soon ***

This game responds to both touch and keyboard inputs

For keyboard,
    use 'w' and 's' to move the left paddle/bat/slider
    and use "up arrow" and "down arrow" to move the right paddle/bat/slider

***A .exe installer for the game will be available soon***

## I will try to make a .apk of this game soon

*** Music playing on the Menu is L's theme(Deathnote) downloaded from https://youtu.be/qR6dzwQahOM
