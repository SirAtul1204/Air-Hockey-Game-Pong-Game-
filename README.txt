**This may have some bugs, I will try to fix them in future**

This is my version of the Air Hockey (Pong) Game developed using Python3 and Kivy 1.11.0

To run this program, you need to
    Download Python3, PyGame and Kivy 1.11.0
    Run main.py
    Enjoy!



This game responds to both touch, keyboard and joystick(GamePad) inputs

For keyboard,
    use 'w' and 's' to move the left paddle/bat/slider
    and use "up arrow" and "down arrow" to move the right paddle/bat/slider

**An .exe Installer of the game is also provided you can just install and run AirHockey.exe to try it out (You won't need to download Python3 or Kivy)**

## I will try to make a .apk of this game soon
